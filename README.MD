# AIF TO MP3
A simple tool to convert aif recordings in Ableton Live to mp3 files. Can convert a single file or a whole directory of files. In the future, it will also be able to recognise the silences within the files and split files accordingly. 

## Commands
### Convert a single file
`python3 aif_to_mp3.py -f <path_to_file>`
### Convert a directory of files
`python3 aif_to_mp3.py -d <path_to_directory>`

## Dependencies
Install the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
